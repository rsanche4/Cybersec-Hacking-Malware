Cogito Trojan by Rafael Sanchez

Inspired by the Anime Ergo Proxy,
cogito is a Trojan Malware that
simulates what it would be like if
your computer became self-aware.
It learns things from Wikipedia
and uses that knowledge to generate
thoughts.
Run the .exe when ready to be 
launched. I also provided the script
if anyone is interested in taking a
look.
