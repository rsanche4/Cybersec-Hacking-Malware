A cute ransomware with a chibi character that encrypts all the files in your home folders for the logged user!

But of course, you can get them all back to normal after playing a game and getting 1 000 000 points...

The .exe version is in the dist/ folder. Move it to the folder where all the other game assets are for everything to run smooth.

Good luck :)
