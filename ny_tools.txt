RESOURCES:
------------------------------------------------------------------------ A -------------------------------------------------------------------
AIRCRACK-NG:
> To crack WEP, we need to capture a lot of packets sent on a busy network to capture the Init Vector with all information for cracking the key. After
sniffing this network, if it's a busy network (has a #Data going up super fast), just do: aircrack-ng <name of file.cap passed by airodump-ng>
Use the KEY FOUND thing, and that's your password to the network so that you can connect.
> If we notice that the network isn't busy, then we are going to do a fake authentication attack, after we have become associated
with the network, now we need to do a ARP Request Replay (wait for ARP request transmitted and then retransmit it to generate more IVs),
so that we increase the traffic: See Aireplay-ng. To crack file: aircrack-ng <name of file: usually aireplay.cap>
for more.
> For a wordlist attack: aircrack-ng <file with handshake> -w <txt file with all guessed passwords>

AIREPLAY-NG:
Good for a variey of attacks. Good for Deauth attack.
> To do a deauth attack, run two terminals. In one terminal run airodump-ng specifically sniffing a target network, and then in other 
terminal: aireplay-ng --deauth <Number of packets to send> -a <MAC of target network> -c <MAC of station or client> (-D if network runs on 5G) 
<wireless adapter>
> to do a fakeauth attack, do: aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a <BSSID Of Target Network> -h <MAC ADDress of our wireless adapter: use ifconfig> 
<wireless adapter>
> To do a ARP Request Replay attack, do: aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b <BSSID Of Target Network> -h <MAC ADDress of our wireless adapter: use ifconfig> 
<wireless adapter>, then see aircrack for reading and cracking aireplay file.

AIRODUMP-NG:
Good for a variety of hacks, especially pre-connection attacks.
> To sniff specific target: airodump-ng --bssid <MAC_Target> --channel <channel> --write <name_of_file> <Wireless Adapter in monitor mode>

AIRMON-NG:
A really good tool for a vairiety of hacks.
> It turns wireless adapter to monitor mode to look around a network: airmon-ng check kill, airmon-ng start <wireless adapter>. And to 
disable: airmon-ng stop <wireless adapter>.

ARP Requests:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol
The Address Resolution Protocol is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as a MAC address, associated 
with a given internet layer address, typically an IPv4 address.
> Do: arp -a   to see table with ip -> MAC address
> Note that many are dymanic. If we configure the network manually to be static, then the MAC Address will not be allowed to change, and thus
the arp poison won't work.

ARP Spoofing:
Great tool for doing arp spoofing attacks.
> Do: arpspoof -i (interface eth0 or wlan0) -t <ip of target> <ip of router or gateway>, also don't forget to enable port forwarding, see portforwarding for more 

AUDACITY:
A great windows tool for modifying audio. Can prove useful for changing voice, stuff like that.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ B -------------------------------------------------------------------
BAD USB:
https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/make-your-own-bad-usb-0165419/
A bad usb is recognized as a keyboard or as an input device that connects to a computer.

BEENVERIFIED:
Reverse Phone search. Beenverified.com

BETTER CAP:
Great and much better tool for man in the middle attack.
> Do: First net.probe on and this will start the net.recon, then net.show to see all connected clients,  then set arp.spoof.fullduplex true, and then
set arp.spoof.targets <IP Address of your target and victim>, then run arp.spoof on. Then set net.sniff.local true (This takes care of the
HTTPS issue later explained. When we are setting the page to HTTP, Bettercap might think these are local passwords and it won't show them so set it to true)
And to capture the data and show the stuff you do: net.sniff on
> To feed a file with all commands we want to run automatically, do: bettercap -iface wlan0 -caplet /root/Desktop/spoof.cap 
> Note that most of this will work for HTTP pages. So to get to see the usernames and passwords, we want to show the HTTP version of a HTTPS website.
So just run the HSTS Bypass Caplet, this caplet comes with bettercap. Caplets.show to show all caplets we have. To run these caplets, just put their name.
/usr/share/bettercap/caplets/hstshijack/hstshijack.cap is the one that takes care of the https.
> But some websites have hsts, and this is trickier to bypass (Facebook, twitter, etc). So to bypass this, we can simply send back a wrong website.
Instead of Facebook.com -> Facebook.corn. This attack works exactly like the previous one, but the problem is that: User has to first go to google.ie (actually
type it out, and that's because the browsr itself has a local telling it that it should only load for example facebook.com on hsts) and then the user types
from Google.ie Not Secure is loaded (which was hijacked and now it loaded the fake google.com) and then type there facebook, for this to work
> For a DNS Spoofing Attack: You can start your own webserver and redirect them there: service apache2 start..... and then: see dns.spoof in bettercap:
dns.spoof.address has the IP that you want to redirect them to, by default it goes to your ip of the interface (Note: if you want to send them
to a different website just cuz, that won't work because using the ip address of those websites are public. This only works with private IP addresses). 
dns.spoof.all = true then bettercap will respond with any dns request. Set the spoof.domains to the websites you want to spoof. NOTE That this only works 
for non-hsts website
> We can also do Evil Code Injection (Http and https and hsts thru weird google) by simple adding the .js file next to the keylogger.js in the hsts pluggin cap.
> If you want to store all your data to a file, then: set net.sniff.output location_Of_file/file.cap

IP ADDRESS LOCATION LOOKUP:
https://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-lookup
A very good site for finding where is somebody based according to their ip address over the internet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ K -------------------------------------------------------------------
KEYLOGGER TROJAN:
https://www.thepythoncode.com/article/write-a-keylogger-python
A keylogger is great because if we can get a machine infected with this trojan, then it will log every key that we are typing and send this to
an attacker, including passwords and usernames. The URL teaches how to write our own keylogger in python.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ L -------------------------------------------------------------------
LINKEDIN:
A great site for finding white collar workers. Keep in mind that when you see people's profiles, it lets them know you saw them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ M -------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------ N -------------------------------------------------------------------
NETDISCOVER:
Netdiscover is a simple ARP scanner which can be used to scan for live hosts in a network.
> Do: netdiscover -r <IP RANGE ex: 10.0.1.1/24 for all in ranges of this IP Subnet. If we are using wifi, then just use your wireless adapter
IP and do the same command to pick all IPs in that range in that network>

NMAP:
Like Netdiscover but a whole lot better and shows you a lot more info, just a little bit slower.
> Do: zenmap

------------------------------------------------------------------------ P -------------------------------------------------------------------
PEOPLE FINDER:
https://www.intelius.com/access/?utm_source=GOOGSRCH&traffic[source]=GOOGSRCH&utm_medium=&traffic[medium]=&utm_campaign=CM-Top+PeopleFinder&traffic[campaign]=AG-PeopleFinder:CM-Top+PeopleFinder&utm_term=CRE-Res+PeopleFinder+BracketEnterAnyName&traffic[term]=CRE-Res+PeopleFinder+BracketEnterAnyName&utm_content=LP-475&traffic[content]=LP-475&s1=CM-Top+PeopleFinder&s2=AG-PeopleFinder&s3=CRE-Res+PeopleFinder+BracketEnterAnyName&s4=LP-475&s5=people+finder&traffic[funnel]=tf&traffic[sub_id]=CM-Top+PeopleFinder&traffic[s2]=AG-PeopleFinder&subtheme=&tone=generic&gclid=CjwKCAjw-sqKBhBjEiwAVaQ9a5q-3nqn9SXFPWXxWViVUmj62IyS56SsvJJmtD2TyP2B4Rl1TEUhOxoCmQsQAvD_BwE
If you want to search for a certain person and things like that, this can help track them down by looking all around the web.

PHONE LOOKUP:
https://www.instantcheckmate.com/?utm_source=193S&traffic[source]=193S&utm_medium=affiliate&traffic[medium]=affiliate&utm_campaign=1JULSM-JE&traffic[campaign]=:1JULSM-JE&utm_term=&traffic[term]=&utm_content=&traffic[content]=&s1=1JULSM-JE&s2=&s3=&s4=&s5=&traffic[funnel]=bg&traffic[sub_id]=1JULSM-JE&traffic[s2]=
https://www.usphonebook.com/
A great website for looking for the indentity of a phone number. It also allows to search more stuff about the person.

PHOTO EXIF DATA AND LOCATION SCRAPER:
https://www.pic2map.com/chvb.html
Great website for extracting the location and place of a certain photo.

PIMEYES:
https://pimeyes.com/en
Interesting look up place where the face of a person is matched accross the internet. Good if you have headshot photo of person.

PORT FORWARDING:
Needs to be enabled for a man in the middle attack.
> Do: echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

PROXY CHAINING:
https://youtu.be/qsA8zREbt6g?list=LL
A great utility in Kali that allows us to mask our identiy when using it by setting up multiple proxies around the world.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ R -------------------------------------------------------------------
REAVER:
Good utility to guess every PIN combination in a WPS attack.
> reaver --bssid <BSSID> --channel <Channel> --interface <wireless adapter> -vvv --no-associate (The vvv shows
as much info as possible and no associate is to not associate with the network cuz we are doing that already)

RENSENWARE:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rensenware
Rensenware is the Anime Ransomware. It's more of a joke, but it encrypts all your files and forces you to play a touhou and score a
really high score.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ S -------------------------------------------------------------------
SECURITY.ORG
https://www.security.org/
A great website listing various things about staying anonymous online, vpn, etc.

SHERLOCK - PYTHON HACKING TOOL:
https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock
A Good Python tool for finding people when you know their username, since it searches for the person in all social media. 

SPOOFING PHONE:
https://www.spoofmyphone.com/
You do have to sign up and it does cost, but it's used to imitate the phone of another person.

SSH:
A good service to remotely control a device. Note that a phone that has been jailbroken will have this service installed by default, and by doing
root ssh@IP_Addres of phone we can access the phone. If asked for a password, try the default "alpine"

------------------------------------------------------------------------ T -------------------------------------------------------------------
TEMPORARY EMAIL:
https://temp-mail.org/en/
Great place where we can hide use throwaway email addresses that are temporary.

TEMPORARY PHONES:
A group of websites that allow you to get free disposable phone numbers.

TOR BROWSER:
The number 1 secret browser in the internet. If you access a site that has the .onion extension, you cannot be tracked by your ISP or GOV. 
> Note that when you want to launch it, you have to be non-root user in kali. run: torbrowser-launcher

------------------------------------------------------------------------ V -------------------------------------------------------------------
VEHICLE LICENCE PLATE LOOKUP:
https://www.beenverified.com/?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=BV_VIN_SEA_PRP_CAR_License_Plate_Exact&utm_term=&utm_content=445444464657&matchtype=e&adgroup=License_Plate_Lookup&device=c&g_network=g&g_adid=445444464657&g_keyword=licence%20plate%20lookup&g_campaign=BV_VIN_SEA_PRP_CAR_License_Plate_Exact&g_adtype=search&g_adgroupid=103160704306&g_keywordid=kwd-759478385&g_acctid=390-501-7298&g_campaignid=10436359657&gclid=CjwKCAjw-sqKBhBjEiwAVaQ9a-9ldd9SuKizOPV2dKM6Ox93XT9gt_-5_7lDtJu5hca1ZcCIiQpZwBoCQUoQAvD_BwE
This is great for researching more about a certain vehicle, assuming we know their licence plate.

VIRTUAL MACHINE:
Very important for running things that we might think are not safe. Also allows us to create a hacking lab. Linux VM is very popular. You can also
run Windows VMs and those are really good. Here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/ Also beware of NAT network vs 
bridged adapter network. If you want to access the real network outside of the Virtual Machine, you need to turn it to Bridged Adapter in settings.

VPN:
Really great for hiding online. When visiting .onion sites with Tor, a VPN will be more than enough to hide and mask our identity even further.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ W -------------------------------------------------------------------
WASH FOR IDENTIFYING WPS:
A feature that comes with many routers is WPS. Often disabled by default, and often requires to press a button to connect to printers quicker. BUT if it's
enabled, and there is no need for a button to be pressed, then we can use this feature to connect without doing a wordlist attack: 
wash --interface <wireless adapter name: mon0>. Then after this, run a fakeauth attack (with 30 seconds to associate every 30 s and not 0), and then 
run Reaver to guess every PIN in the WPS. 

WIFI HOTSPOT:
https://github.com/lakinduakash/linux-wifi-hotspot
Great tool for creating a Fake Access Point. For this attack, you need your wireless adapter NOT connected to wifi (wlan0), and your interface connected to 
internet (eth0).

WIRELESS ADAPTER:
https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wireless+adapters&i=electronics&gclid=CjwKCAjw-sqKBhBjEiwAVaQ9a0Pt5p1aPVwCtEksk34JWTAbwSDnultYTvz_mM9KoPSF81wPTYgG2BoCl0gQAvD_BwE&hvadid=173536719091&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9003503&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=14488061453758891733&hvtargid=kwd-93027552&hydadcr=19107_9439002&tag=googhydr-20&ref=pd_sl_89bz80caml_e
Wireless Adapters help us monitor networks and start a variety of attacks. Important to change its mode to Monitor to really sniff everything.

WIRESHARK:
Really good for opening .cap files that have all sort of information regarding packets in a network. A network analyzer, not designed for hackers.
It works by seeing all the flow of traffic through an interface. NOT A HACKING TOOL. Traffic through your own computer.
> Just type wireshark and it runs. Then become Man in the middle, see bettercap for more on this. In options you can select which interface to sniff on,
and on output you can store that data somewhere for later if you want. Actually use this because it has so much more information regarding data sent.
> This is a good tool also when we are trying to detect an arp poision attack. By analyzing the network traffic, we might get a lot of
requests coming from a certain IP address. (Note: This will be the attacker's IP Address. This is good because it reveals the attacker's
identity. If we were to attack somebody, now we know how important are proxy chains where this IP would be completely different, tho I need to
check this)

WPA/WPA2:
Most famous encryption in the world right now. To crack it open, you first need to capture The Handshake (To do this just do a sniffing attack
on the target network and write the data to a file using airodump-ng). Then you have to wait for a client to connect (Do a Deauth attack
if no one connects) and once you have a file with a handshake, and after that use crunch to do a wordlist text for a wordlist attack. See aircrack 
to do the attack with the wordlist file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ X -------------------------------------------------------------------
Xarp
Checks for a possible ARP Poisioning attack. Really good application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ W -------------------------------------------------------------------
Whois Record
https://www.whois.com/whois/
Finds the domains of a website and you can gain information on it and all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ 4 -------------------------------------------------------------------
4chan:
https://www.4chan.org/
Anonymous, and there are interesting people here that might know more about certain media like moves, series, etc. Useful for tracking famous,
scenes from media, etc.
